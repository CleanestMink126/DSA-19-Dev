### Pset Problems

Finally, write a java solution in `PsetProblems` to problems 6 and 7 on the in class problem set:

* Given a string of open and close parenthesis, determine the longest substring that contains a valid expression. If you want an additional challenge, restrict yourself to using only one stack as additional storage.
* Sort a stack in ascending order (with smallest items on top). The only extra memory you may use is one additional stack to hold items (you cannot use any arrays). Return the sorted stack. O(N^2) time.

Use the tests in `test.PsetTest` to verify your solutions.
